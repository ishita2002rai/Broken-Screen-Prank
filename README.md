## 🔧 Demo Stages

1. **CRT Noise Phase** (0–3.5s)
   - Screen is filled with animated static noise, mimicking an old CRT TV.

2. **Fake Crash Modal**
   - Displays a fake system crash screen.
   - Text:  
     ```
     Your device ran into a problem :(
     Press F to restart.
     ```

3. **Shatter Mode**
   - Activated when user presses `F`.
   - Fullscreen + cursor hidden.
   - Clicking anywhere creates a **complex radial glass-breaking effect** with:
     - 💡 Glow burst
     - 💫 Cracked ring patterns
     - ⚡ Shards & micro fractures
     - 🌐 Primary and secondary branching cracks
